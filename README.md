# Chrome OS Serial Test

This is a quick test program to test receiving on the serial port of a Chromebook.  There are many better serial monitor programs out there; you probably want one of them.  The point of this code is to be extremely simple to use as a testbed.  If you're using an Arduino, I highly recommend using http://codebender.cc instead.
